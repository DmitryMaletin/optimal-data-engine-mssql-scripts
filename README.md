## What Optimal Data Engine Scripts does: ##
This project contains a collection of scripts, which you are free to use, at your own risk, to make working with ODE Configuration easier and more standard.

## Requirements (All users): ##
It is assumed that you have an ODE installation as these scripts all relate to ODE configuration.
ODE itself can be downloaded from the related project - "optimal-data-engine-mssql", which has it's own installation instructions. 

## Branches: ##
Currently, ODE Scripts has two Branches available:
* master and
* develop

Master contains code which is known to be running in a production environment.

Develop contains the latest, locally tested version of the codebase.

## Download and build instructions: ##
If you wish to develop the code base further, we recommend that you use the Visual Studio solution which is provided.

The Project contains a number of discrete scripts, which you can copy off the GitHub website, or from the project zip.

### Pre-requisites ###

* Download a copy of the zip and extract to a temporary folder
 
## Current functionality: ##
Details of the current ODE functionality can be found here http://www.ode.ninja/category/features/
These scripts are linked on a number of pages in http://www.ode.ninja/, where there usage is dicussed in more detail.

## Notes ##
* Untested on SQL Server editions prior to 2014
